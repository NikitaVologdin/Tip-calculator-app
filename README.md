## Overview

The tip calculator app has a layout for mobile and desktop versions. Uses css grid and flexbox. Shows success and error states via style on input. The app has client-side validation on inputs and displays an error message according to input validation failure. The app can display results up to 8 digit number. The reset button clears inputs and results. Added TypeScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
